# A_Fake_Version_of_CharlesAI
An unfinished self-driving version of self-driving AI in GTA5

This is an simplified version of Charles self-driving AI:
1.less actions: W A D WA WD NK.
2.no obstacles, main goal is just stay in lines while driving.
3.no dashboard, full screen of scene.

However, due to shortage of storage, time and data batches, I haven't finished the train process of this AI.

I just wonder if there is any method can reduce the scale of required data. lol

Awesome dudes, I need ur help :(
